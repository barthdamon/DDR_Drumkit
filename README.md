# DDR_Drumkit
Max4 Live plugin that lets you map a DDR (dance dance revolution) stomp pad controller (or any HID device, like a ps4 controller for instance) to a drum kit or other MIDI instrument in Ableton 


HOW TOS:

Activating:
1) Make sure the parseddrpad.js is in the same root as the plugin
2) Make sure you are playing, but set to auto and no track is playing on the midi track with the plugin
3) Play the project
4) hit notes and see them appear in a drum rack

MidiMapping:
1) Enable a new port in audio to midi
2) Set an external instrument in the drum rack
3) Make each external instrument channel unique
4) Enter midi map mode, and press the buttons to the corresponding external instruments
